              <h4>Bugfixing</h4>
              <p>
                I was right, the Spotify widget was indeed buggy. I had to do some digging 
                around and I found out that while its true that lyric websites can use the 
                Spotify API to play samples of songs. Spotify canceled their API service that 
                allowed for that. Thats why the 30 second previews weren't working. I've fixed 
                it now but its taken a lot of effort. Long story short, I needed to change the 
                previews to use itunes, then setup a backend server to host the API calls to itunes. 
                Then I had to adjust a ton of the code to make sure it worked with the new API and 
                the code isn't just hard coded to only work on specific websites, but can work on 
                any website that uses the API. There were so many bugs to fix today, I've totally lost track. 
                I guess thats why people do devlogs, to make up where memory fails.
              </p>
              
              <h4>More css and assets</h4>
              <p>
                So I added some fun css to convert the rain effect to a firefly effect. A little off 
                topic but I love the firefly bushes in minecraft, they have such nice ambient sounds 
                and they're pretty to look at. I like rain a lot, but I wanna be a little more original, 
                anyways the vibe is still relatively cozy I think. I also added a video background and 
                website music. For the record I didn't make either, both assets were from free use websites, 
                and the respective owners are credited in the footer of the website. I actually had to 
                track down the creator of the video myself, they weren't listed on pixabay's website as 
                the orignal creator. Maybe one day I'll make my own video background and music, but for now I think 
                the current assets go a really long way in making the website feel more alive. I wanted 
                to do a cafe theme originally for my website, but it sorta just turned into this instead. 
                It's very discord/steam/spotify inspired. Oh and the video background actually has a css filter applied to it. 
                I learned that trick in web dev class. I think it works well with the existing color scheme.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Whats next?</h4>
              <p>
                The website is now in a state where I can call it ready to be launched. I'll probably 
                continue to update it and add more stuff as I learn more. But for now I need to focus 
                on getting a better job, and updating my resume before that. I wonder if I should add 
                the code of the spotify widget I made to the projects page. I think it would be a good 
                idea, but ahh I'm so tired right now, I'll think about it later. Surely this is my last all 
                nighter, surely! (haha) This was a lot of fun to do, I'll consider this website in a 
                state of "soft launch". My friend wanted me to help with his game he's making. The genre of 
                the game isn't super intriguing to me, but despite the genre, any game could have a good story. 
                Might be a fun project to work on.

              <h4>Adjusting Career Page</h4>
              <p>
                This is taking a more effort than I'd like. I always forget how iffy web development is, 
                I think I spent more than a fair share of my time today restyling the website and making 
                everything look better. I'm kinda miffed I'm still not done. Anyways, I added the details of 
                the classes I took in HighSchool and College. As well as some information from my resume.
                Ah that reminds me, I should probably add a resume page to the website.
              </p>
              
              <h4>The Projects Page</h4>
              <p>
                I finally added all the projects I've done over the years to the projects page. It's not 
                technically all of them, but it's a good start overall. I still need to take screenshots of 
                some of the projects for the projects cover photos. That reminds me, I talked to an old teammate 
                today to get the repository for the game we made in college, and I found out he has his own website 
                too. It's really cool and has transition animations. I might consider doing something like that. 
                I also kind of want background music or sounds for the website, in media, sound design can make a 
                very big difference in the overall feel of a space. I think it would be a nice touch.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Thoughts for improvement and Things I wanna do</h4>
              <p>
                Aughhhh I'm so tired. Right now the biggest thing I want to do is sleep haha, been pulling too 
                many all nighters lately. But in all seriousness, I'm hoping to have this done for the most part by 
                tomorrow. Afterwards... I kinda wanna make scripts for fun things, like music, and particle effects, 
                and little animations. I also sort of want a chibi version of myself on the website instead of using 
                my discord profile picture. My drawing skills are a little rusty, doing pixel art over the years has 
                definitely made me a little out of practice with drawing. I never trained myself in more animated art 
                styles, but I'm sure I can learn. Also I think the Spotify widget is a little buggy, something feels off 
                about it. I'll investigate it more later, it's supposed to play samples of songs but no samples are showing 
                up at all. Super sus.

              <h4>Adding Scripts!</h4>
              <p>
                I'm technically still not done getting the website set up yet, but I thought it would be fun 
                to add some more scripts and personalize the website a bit more. I'm trying to add a spotify widget 
                to the website that shows my last played song(s). If possible I'd like there to be a play button 
                that shows the 30 second sample of the song, I've seen it before on lyric websites.
              </p>
              
              <h4>What am I working on right now?</h4>
              <p>
                As of now I still dont have my career page set up yet, I want to have it all nice and neat.
                Also I added my about page and I changed the styling a little from the prior version, I'm trying 
                to have it look like the way steam profiles are set up, with the banner at the top and the
                profile picture on the left side. I also did a bunch of bugfixes for the blog page and added the 
                tag filtering system.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Thoughts for improvement and Things I wanna do</h4>
              <p>
                Right now I feel like the background of my website is a little bland, I want a more personalized 
                background and I think it would be so cool to have more animated elements on the page. Dimden's site 
                has animated rain particles and thunder sounds, I love that vibe a lot. I think it's brilliant. 
                Other than that, I'm considering changing the color scheme of the site. The current color was what my 
                client wanted which was a dark gray for simplicity. But I feel like I can make it cozier, so we'll see 
                if anything changes on that front.

              <h4>Getting Started with Dev Logs</h4>
              <p>
                So I've never really done a dev log before in my own capacity, I've done a lot of 
                projects in school and I'm pretty good at documenting my work and writing reports. 
                Althought now that I'm doing it on my own, it feels a little different. Anyways, I guess
                working on this website and getting it set up would probably qualify it for a dev log post.
                So yeah, yippie.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Whats happening right now?</h4>
              <p>
                The code for this website was originally written for a client project I did in college for 
                web development class. While game dev was my main focus, I had to take classes like web development, and 
                machine learning, as well as SQL and database management and more. I'm straying off topic, but as I 
                write this post, I'm still in the process of coding this website and converting the content and code to 
                be more personal and less client based. 
              </p>
              
              <h4>Thoughts for improvement and Things I wanna do</h4>
              <p>
                Right now I'm writing this post in the actual devlog.html file. But I know that in forum websites 
                like reddit, they have a system where you can make posts and leave comments and stuff on the actual website. 
                I don't know how to do that yet, but it's something I'll likely have to consider if I keep doing these 
                posts. Having a comment section would be a good way to get feedback, and more importantly a on-site way 
                to make posts may make creating these posts significantly easier than writing them in the actual code.
