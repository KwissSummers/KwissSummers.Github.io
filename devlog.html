              <h4>Getting Started with Dev Logs</h4>
              <p>
                So I've never really done a dev log before in my own capacity, I've done a lot of 
                projects in school and I'm pretty good at documenting my work and writing reports. 
                Althought now that I'm doing it on my own, it feels a little different. Anyways, I guess
                working on this website and getting it set up would probably qualify it for a dev log post.
                So yeah, yippie.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Whats happening right now?</h4>
              <p>
                The code for this website was originally written for a client project I did in college for 
                web development class. While game dev was my main focus, I had to take classes like web development, and 
                machine learning, as well as SQL and database management and more. I'm straying off topic, but as I 
                write this post, I'm still in the process of coding this website and converting the content and code to 
                be more personal and less client based. 
              </p>
              
              <h4>Thoughts for improvement and Things I wanna do</h4>
              <p>
                Right now I'm writing this post in the actual devlog.html file. But I know that in forum websites 
                like reddit, they have a system where you can make posts and leave comments and stuff on the actual website. 
                I don't know how to do that yet, but it's something I'll likely have to consider if I keep doing these 
                posts. Having a comment section would be a good way to get feedback, and more importantly a on-site way 
                to make posts may make creating these posts significantly easier than writing them in the actual code.

              Styling the website

              <h4>Adding Scripts!</h4>
              <p>
                I'm technically still not done getting the website set up yet, but I thought it would be fun 
                to add some more scripts and personalize the website a bit more. I'm trying to add a spotify widget 
                to the website that shows my last played song(s). If possible I'd like there to be a play button 
                that shows the 30 second sample of the song, I've seen it before on lyric websites.
              </p>
              
              <h4>What am I working on right now?</h4>
              <p>
                As of now I still dont have my career page set up yet, I want to have it all nice and neat.
                Also I added my about page and I changed the styling a little from the prior version, I'm trying 
                to have it look like the way steam profiles are set up, with the banner at the top and the
                profile picture on the left side. I also did a bunch of bugfixes for the blog page and added the 
                tag filtering system.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Thoughts for improvement and Things I wanna do</h4>
              <p>
                Right now I feel like the background of my website is a little bland, I want a more personalized 
                background and I think it would be so cool to have more animated elements on the page. Dimden's site 
                has animated rain particles and thunder sounds, I love that vibe a lot. I think it's brilliant. 
                Other than that, I'm considering changing the color scheme of the site. The current color was what my 
                client wanted which was a dark gray for simplicity. But I feel like I can make it cozier, so we'll see 
                if anything changes on that front.
