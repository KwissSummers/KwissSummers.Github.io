            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm Chris. I'm recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte,
              I graduated with a bachelor's of science in Computer Science, with a concentration in 
              AI, Robotics and Game Development. 
              
              I have a lot of different interests and took a large
              variety of courses with my time in the education system, anything from business and marketing
              to sports medicine, psychology, nutrition, biology, art, history and of course, computer science.
              
              My passion in learning and creating led me to develop a love for video games, which I consider
              the ultimate art form that combines a wide variety of different skills and talents from a large
              variety of different fields of knowledge. This led me to attend college to pursue a career in 
              game development, which led to learning computer science and programming.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I generally have two principles I've always followed in life. One is to always keep learning, 
              learning new things is really fun! I've always kept a open mind, and I'm always willing to try
              new things. 
              
              The second is my approach to people in social and conflict situations. I believe
              that everyone has the right to pursue what makes them happy, and as long as all parties involved
              in said pursuit are consenting and others aren't being harmed, then all is well.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              When I'm not working, you can find me spending time with friends, 
              playing video games (I'm always playing something!), coding, or creating/consuming art/media.
              I grew up on the internet, so I'm a huge internet junkie. :D

          <h3>Whats it looking like for me career wise?</h3>
          <p>
            Right now as a fresh graduate, I understand that no matter how much I've learned in school.
            There's still and will always be more to learn. Right now I'm seeking a position where I can grow
            as a person and a developer and learn from others. Game design and development has and most likely
            will always be my passion and end goal, but realistically I understand that I need to start somewhere.
            I'm looking to get my foot into the computer science industry and gain experience as a professional.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-box">
          <h3>Favorite tools and technologies?</h3>
          <p>
            So I've learned a lot of different computer science languages in college, I started off with
            java for my first language, then learned python, C, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL
            off the top of my head. I also have experience with software like Unity and GameMaker 
            and surface level knowledge of Unreal Engine, Audacity and Blender.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now I'm trying to learn more about Unreal Engine as it's a really powerful tool
            for game development in the right hands. I also want to properly learn Blender and 3D modeling,
            I have an background in art and as someone who appreciates the arts and media, it's a skill
            I'd like to pick up. Whether thats video editing, sound design, asset creation, etc.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-box">
          <h3>Your approach to projects?</h3>
          <p>
            I believe in thorough planning, clear communication, and iterative development. 
            I start by understanding the requirements and goals, then break down complex 
            problems into manageable pieces. Across all the classes I've taken and projects I've done, 
            this is probably the one consistent thing I've learned. That being said, every team is different,
            but this is my own personal preference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collaboration and communication are extremely important to me. There will always be someone
            who knows more than you do in a certain area, or someone whos better at something than you are.
            But I think it's an incredible opportunity to learn from others and share knowledge.
            Knowledge is power, and that power can make the world a better place in any way, shape or form.
            I want to be surrounded by talented and passionate people, and I want to be more like them,
            and ideally, contribute to their growth and the growth of the world around me. 
            Even if it's just a little bit. A silly ideal, but it's a thought that makes me smile.
          </p>

        <div class="about-box">
          <h3>Outside of work?</h3>
          <p>
            Gaming is a huge part of my life, I'm thinking about games and theorycrafting and running ideas
            and numbers in my head all the time. I love to play games, and I love to learn about them, I adore
            worldbuilding and lore, I love following guide content and the development of games. I could
            yap about games for hours on end. That being said, I also enjoy working out, and I sometimes 
            window shop for fun, whether its clothes, every day tech, or little quality of life things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also like trying foods from different cultures, and I'm currently trying to learn how to cook.
            Cooking reminds me of game development, there's a lot of different things you can do and a lot of
            different ways to do it. You can follow a recipe, or you can experiment and try new things.
            I think it's a great way to express yourself and your creativity. Maybe theres an instinctive
            nature to create instilled in humanity as a whole. Why else would we create things?
