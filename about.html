            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I'm Ohm Desai, the indie developer behind Sock Games. I specialize in creating atmospheric 
              games with immersive environments and engaging gameplay mechanics.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              My passion for game development began during my high school years and continued to grow 
              throughout my academic journey. I'm particularly interested in game engine development and 
              exploring new ways to create interactive experiences.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I graduated from the University of North Carolina in Charlotte and am currently pursuing 
              a master's degree in Computer Science at NC State University.

          <h3>What inspired your work?</h3>
          <p>
            My journey into game development began during high school when I was looking for creative outlets 
            beyond my usual activities. The true turning point came during my junior year of undergrad, when I 
            developed a deep curiosity about how game engines function beneath the surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            This fascination with the technical aspects of game creation has shaped my approach to development 
            and continues to drive my projects today.
          </p>

        <div class="about-box">
          <h3>Favorite games?</h3>
          <p>
            Some of my all-time favorites include Skyrim, Ghost of Tsushima, Stardew Valley, and Outlast. 
            What draws me to these games is their ability to create compelling, immersive worlds that offer 
            unique experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of these titles excels in different aspects of game design—from open-world exploration to 
            atmospheric tension—elements I strive to incorporate into my own work.
          </p>

          <h3>Your creative process?</h3>
          <p>
            My creative process typically begins with a concept that excites me as both a developer and a player. 
            I often start with something playful or unconventional, then refine it into a more structured concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe the best games come from creating experiences I would genuinely want to play myself, 
            which helps ensure authenticity and passion in the final product.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-box">
          <h3>What're your hobbies?</h3>
          <p>
            Outside of game development, I enjoy playing games across various genres to stay inspired and 
            informed about industry trends. I'm also passionate about coding projects beyond games and find 
            cooking to be a rewarding creative outlet.
          </p>
          <p>
            These diverse interests often find their way into my work, influencing both the themes and 
            mechanics of my games.
