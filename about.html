              <h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>
                Hi, I'm Chris. I'm recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte,
                I graduated with a bachelor's of science in Computer Science, with a concentration in 
                AI, Robotics and Game Development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a lot of different interests and took a large
                variety of courses with my time in the education system, anything from business and marketing
                to sports medicine, psychology, nutrition, biology, art, history and of course, computer science.
              </p>
              <p>
                My passion in learning and creating led me to develop a love for video games, which I consider
                the ultimate art form that combines a wide variety of different skills and areas of knowledge. 
                This led me to attend college to pursue a career in game development, which led to learning 
                computer science and programming. Now I'm stuck in this vicious never-ending cycle of learning and creating. 
                Kinda fun though.
              </p>

            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <p>
              Right now as a fresh graduate, I understand that no matter how much I've learned in school,
              there's still and will always be more to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
              Right now I'm seeking a position where I can grow as a person and a developer and learn from others. 
              Game design and development has and most likely will always be my passion and end goal, but realistically 
              I understand that I need to start somewhere.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="detail-card">
            <h3>My Approach to Projects</h3>
            <p>
              I believe in thorough planning, clear communication, and iterative development. 
              I start by understanding the requirements and goals, then break down complex 
              problems into manageable pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Collaboration and communication are extremely important to me. There will always be someone
              who knows more than you do in a certain area, and I think it's an incredible opportunity to learn from others.
            </p>

            <h3>When I'm Not Coding</h3>
            <p>
              Gaming is a huge part of my life, I'm thinking about games and theorycrafting and running ideas
              and numbers in my head all the time. I love to play games, and I love to learn about them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also like trying foods from different cultures, and I'm currently trying to learn how to cook.
              Cooking reminds me of game development - there's a lot of different things you can do and many ways to do it.
            </p>

          <div class="detail-card">
            <h3>My Media Consumption</h3>
            <p>
              I think the content people consume say a lot about who they are, my social media feed is filled with 
              dogs and cats, comics, memes, guide videos, video game patch notes, lore videos, and indie game content.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like listening to indie pop and lo-fi music, my music taste is usually either very low or very high energy
              and no in-between. I enjoy watching anime, but I'd usually prefer to watch lighthearted genres like comedys or isekai.
