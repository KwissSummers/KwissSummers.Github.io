            <p class="devlog-excerpt">
              Hello, this is my first blog post. Honestly I don't know if anyone will ever see this,
              but if anything at least I'll have a record of my thoughts and ideas.
            </p>

              <h4>Getting Started</h4>
              <p>
                I'm not quite sure what I'm doing yet, but I used to keep diaries as a kid, maybe this 
                can be a fun opportunity to do something similar. The main point of this website is to 
                have something to showcase I can code and create things on my resume. But I feel like 
                it would be such a shame if I didn't get to have fun while doing so. 
              </p>
              
              <h4>Something I'm looking into</h4>
              <p>
                I'm actually still coding this website as I write this, so I'm still uncertain how this 
                will all turn out. But I've seen an incredible website I found by <a href="https://dimden.dev/" target="_blank">dimden</a>.
                It's a really cool website that had a lot of love put into it, when I see things like this, these little 
                passion projects people create, I can't help but smile. It's just so cool. This might age poorly but I'd 
                love to make something like that one day. 
              </p>

            <h2>Blog - Thoughts in Summer 2025</h2>
            <p class="devlog-date">Posted: July 26th, 2025</p>
            
            <p class="devlog-excerpt">
              Whoa, it's been a month! I'm surprised it's only been a month honestly.
            </p>

              <h4>What's New</h4>
              <p>
                I've been learning about the comp sci industry while job searching this last month. I tried super hard to 
                understand what's in demand in the market and what I should be focusing on. I think I have a better idea now, 
                I haven't gotten the kind of job I dreamed of yet, haha, but maybe one day. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I was studying today for a coding  evaluation, and I realized the study material I got for it was a really broad overview of coding basics I learned 
                over my 4 years in college. I don't know if it was a rare stroke of luck, but I happened to choose classes that covered 
                everything in the study material flashcards. So conceptually, I understood everything and it was just review. 
                Unfortunately, my actual coding skills have always felt like they've been behind everyone else despite my good grades 
                in the academia. The only way to remedy this is to keep practicing. I'm going to try and work on personal projects for now and see where 
                that takes me. Oh yea, I'm also trying to get better at touch typing, I'm very slowly getting better at it.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Something I'm Considering for This Website</h4>
              <p>
                Ahhh I had an idea the other day, I was on Steam and I noticed that Steam shows your most recently played games. I would 
                love to show my most recently played games on this website similar to the spotify integration I have. I think it would be a fun 
                way to express myself, plus it might be fun to code too. I looked into it a little bit and I think it's super possible, once I 
                have some free time, I definitely want to try and implement it. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Other than that, I need personal projects that are more generalist for the industry. Maybe I can code something like a budget tracker or 
                personal planner for myself, that way I could do something useful for myself and practice some coding skills at the same time. 
                Oh! Before I forget, I might try to recode my website one day in React and Node.js/TypeScript, it seems to be used everywhere in the industry, 
                and I think it would be a good idea to learn it. AWS as well.
              </p>

              <h4>Off Topic Things</h4>
              <p>
                I drove long distance for the first time this week, I went to visit my friend in a different city and the drive there and back was around 
                350 miles. I almost dozed off on the highway a couple times from sheer exhaustion, but I made it back. Other than that, I recently picked up 
                a chore of watering plants in the back and front yard. My parents have an unholy number of plants, it's really pretty, but I can't help but 
                groan about the amount of time and effort it takes to water them all. Not to mention during our heat wave this summer, that being said, maybe this 
                will be a good opportunity to practice my time management skills, and to keep a consistent sleep schedule. Maybe I can even get into the habit of 
                working out in the morning before watering the plants, that way I can get some exercise in too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ah one last thing, it's so bizarre to think about. 
                But I can't help feeling that life in the states isn't as good as I thought it was growing up, we might be an international superpower, but 
                everywhere I look online, it seems like Europe is simply better. Makes me a little sad. Maybe one day I can visit or immigrate to Europe. 
                That could be nice, or maybe things will get better here, I can only hope.

            <h2>Blog - Thoughts in Fall 2025</h2>
            <p class="devlog-date">Posted: September 22nd, 2025</p>
            
            <p class="devlog-excerpt">
              A lot has happened this last month, also yay its Fall.
            </p>

            <div class="devlog-full" hidden>
              <h4>What's New</h4>
              <p>
                I finally started PEP training for a position I'm being considered for, its basically a lot of general core comp sci knowledge. It feels like 
                I'm doing a non academic version of college all over again. But I think it's good for me, it's given me the opportunity to review my comp sci roots 
                without feeling like I'm wasting other opportunities. I think it's a good idea to keep my fundamentals strong, especially since I didn't learn comp sci 
                until I became a freshman in college. My freshman year's comp sci experience was really rough, so it's good to relearn concepts with a better foundation. 
                Truth be told, despite being a comp sci major I've never felt like I was ever that good in coding despite performing relatively well in school since my 
                coding knowledge foundation was so weak. So I'm really counting on this to prove to myself that I can code without crutches.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started learning unreal engine a little more too, my friend has been showing me around the engine and how to use the different systems in Unreal as well 
                as some of the visual coding blueprints. Other than that, I've been working more lately with my part time job as a server. I'm getting more comfortable with 
                it, and it's been pretty fun I think. My only gripen is that I feel like between my job and PEP training and my other responsibilities, my free time has taken 
                a real beating. Theres so much I want to do, but I only have so much time and mental/physical energy to do it all.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Video Games I'm Excited About</h4>
              <p>
                Hehe, can you believe it? Silksong finally came out after all these years. I've been trying to play it whenever I get a chance. It's a lot of fun, admittedly 
                masochistic fun. I've modded my version of it however with some utility and quality of life mods, so it's a little easier for me to play with my lack of time. 
                Other than that, I've been ranking in the Deep of Night mode in Nightreign, and of course I always set some time aside to play my Hoyoverse games. Getting to 
                experience the story and play new characters is the highlight of my week. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I also plan on getting Pokemon Legends ZA, I'm super excited about it. But I'm still struggling to justify buying the Switch 2. I really want to play 
                Legends ZA on a Switch 2, but I don't know if I can justify the cost. I think the price is reasonable after taking into account for inflation, but 
                admittedly its definitely a financially irresponsible purchase for me right now. I also want to get "Little Witch in the Woods", it's a super cute and 
                cozy indie game. Aughhhh I want to play so many games, but I just don't have the time. Theres so much to do! Time truly is a cruel mistress.
              </p>

              <h4>On My Mind</h4>
              <p>
                I still want to get aroud to adding Steam integration to my website. I did research it a little and it should be possible. I just need to get the time 
                to sit down and do it. Theres just so much I want to do, haha I'm just repeating myself at this point. I'm grateful that despite everything happening in the era we 
                live in- that I still have the friends I do. At least I'm not going through it all alone. I used to keep a diary as a kid where I poured my thoughts into, 
                growing up I didn't get a lot of social interaction outside of school because of some familty dynamics. These days I have people I can talk to, so I stopped 
                keeping a diary a long time ago. Heh, I wonder if in another timeline I could've been a therapist bahahaha. 
              </p>
              <p>
                It's silly to think about, but after spending so much time learning corporate/business culture and how to navigate it, I sometimes forget that the people I interact 
                with are people too, and that most of the time we're all just stuck playing our own parts and roles. It's so much easier to dehumanize people when you think of them 
                as just their roles. Real authenticity is so much easier when people can just be themselves, isn't it ironic that growing up we're taught to be ourselves, but as we grow up 
                we're taught to play roles and fit into molds? It's a little sad to think about. Structure is important, but individuality is important too. Maybe I just think too much. 
                Also something I learned recently is that apparently AI uses double -'s a lot in its writing. Like this-- but after seeing it, I cant help but want to use it too, I just 
                think it's neat. Reminds me of all the ways I'd spice up my writing back when I was writing essays for school.
