              Hello, this is my first blog post. Honestly I don't know if anyone will ever see this,
              but if anything at least I'll have a record of my thoughts and ideas.
            </p>

              <h4>Getting Started</h4>
              <p>
                I'm not quite sure what I'm doing yet, but I used to keep diaries as a kid, maybe this 
                can be a fun opportunity to do something similar. The main point of this website is to 
                have something to showcase I can code and create things on my resume. But I feel like 
                it would be such a shame if I didn't get to have fun while doing so. 
              </p>
              
              <h4>Something I'm looking into</h4>
              <p>
                I'm actually still coding this website as I write this, so I'm still uncertain how this 
                will all turn out. But I've seen an incredible website I found by <a href="https://dimden.dev/" target="_blank">dimden</a>.
                It's a really cool website that had a lot of love put into it, when I see things like this, these little 
                passion projects people create, I can't help but smile. It's just so cool. This might age poorly but I'd 
                love to make something like that one day. 
              </p>

            <p class="devlog-date">Posted: July 26th, 2025</p>
            
            <p class="devlog-excerpt">
              Whoa, it's been a month! I'm surprised it's only been a month honestly.

              <h4>What's New</h4>
              <p>
                I've been learning about the comp sci industry while job searching this last month. I tried super hard to 
                understand what's in demand in the market and what I should be focusing on. I think I have a better idea now, 
                I haven't gotten the kind of job I dreamed of yet, haha, but maybe one day. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I was studying today for a coding  evaluation, and I realized the study material I got for it was a really broad overview of coding basics I learned 
                over my 4 years in college. I don't know if it was a rare stroke of luck, but I happened to choose classes that covered 
                everything in the study material flashcards. So conceptually, I understood everything and it was just review. 
                Unfortunately, my actual coding skills have always felt like they've been behind everyone else despite my good grades 
                in the academia. The only way to remedy this is to keep practicing. I'm going to try and work on personal projects for now and see where 
                that takes me. Oh yea, I'm also trying to get better at touch typing, I'm very slowly getting better at it.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Something I'm Considering for This Website</h4>
              <p>
                Ahhh I had an idea the other day, I was on Steam and I noticed that Steam shows your most recently played games. I would 
                love to show my most recently played games on this website similar to the spotify integration I have. I think it would be a fun 
                way to express myself, plus it might be fun to code too. I looked into it a little bit and I think it's super possible, once I 
                have some free time, I definitely want to try and implement it. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Other than that, I need personal projects that are more generalist for the industry. Maybe I can code something like a budget tracker or 
                personal planner for myself, that way I could do something useful for myself and practice some coding skills at the same time. 
                Oh! Before I forget, I might try to recode my website one day in React and Node.js/TypeScript, it seems to be used everywhere in the industry, 
                and I think it would be a good idea to learn it. AWS as well.
              </p>

              <h4>Off Topic Things</h4>
              <p>
                I drove long distance for the first time this week, I went to visit my friend in a different city and the drive there and back was around 
                350 miles. I almost dozed off on the highway a couple times from sheer exhaustion, but I made it back. Other than that, I recently picked up 
                a chore of watering plants in the back and front yard. My parents have an unholy number of plants, it's really pretty, but I can't help but 
                groan about the amount of time and effort it takes to water them all. Not to mention during our heat wave this summer, that being said, maybe this 
                will be a good opportunity to practice my time management skills, and to keep a consistent sleep schedule. Maybe I can even get into the habit of 
                working out in the morning before watering the plants, that way I can get some exercise in too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ah one last thing, it's so bizarre to think about. 
                But I can't help feeling that life in the states isn't as good as I thought it was growing up, we might be an international superpower, but 
                everywhere I look online, it seems like Europe is simply better. Makes me a little sad. Maybe one day I can visit or immigrate to Europe. 
                That could be nice, or maybe things will get better here, I can only hope.
              </p>
