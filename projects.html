                I ended up buying procreate to create the art assets, and while I never trained in digital art, it was fun to learn to use layers and different brushes to create art. Conceptually I understand how to create art, but truthfully, I need a lot more practice.
                <br><br>
                Digital art feels very different from traditional art. But I do think it's the future.

                <br><br>
                Anyways, it's a combat platformer that was actually sorta fun to play overall. I also did the video editing for the trailer and it was my first time being exposed to Davinci Studio.

                I also coded in a display case at the request of LD where you can view items you've collected and rotate their 3D models ingame, Resident Evil style. LD said he's still working on the game, I think he wants it to be officially released one day.

                I've been trying really hard to create a hollow knight ish bossfight for what seems like forever, my senior year capstone game was my latest attempt at doing so. I had to take my capstone a semester early due to scheduling conflicts so I went into it without a lot of experience.
                <br><br>
                Anyways, conceptually it played very similarly to hollow knight, there were a ton of assets and animations made for the game. Unfortunately you wont be able to see them because the boss had some game breaking bugs that I couldn't fix in time for the demo.
                <br><br>
                If anything, it taught me a lot more about how to code with unity and the work that goes into making a game. Even a single boss fight in the game required me to code a lot of systems for a functioning game. I wonder if the code could be salvaged, I might try to fix it up one day or repurpose it.

                <br><br>
                It also has a lot of filter and sorting options, and different popup windows and whatnot. Honestly I feel like I've been learning more about UI/UX design lately than I have about coding gameplay mechanics.
                <br><br>
                It's mildly disheartening, but at least I'm understanding what I'm doing. It kinda reminds me of web development actually.

                <br><br>
                It honestly wasn't too hard to do. This was one of my first experiences working with a team, I actually had to do more leading than playing behind the scenes support too. Mostly because my teammates were a little shy and reserved, but I think we did pretty well.
                <br><br>
                I've never been one to take a leading role, but this experience taught me I could, working with everyones strengths and filling in where we were weak. I've never considered myself the best coder, I didn't even learn to code before coming to college, but as a generalist I really do feel like I'm contributing by covering for weak spots.
                <br><br>
                The industry wants us to specialize though, so I'm trying.

                I think I did a pretty good job on it, as for how it turned out, well. It's actually the foundation code for this website. I altered the css styling and a lot of the scripts and html files to customize it more to my own tastes.

                This was a final project with just one week to complete. Originally I wanted to analyze endgame gamemodes character usage databases for gacha games. unfortunately, those databases aren't open to the public, I ended up settling on a credit card fraud database.
                <br><br>
                The goal was to build a machine learning model that could detect fraudulent transactions. Conceptually it wasn't too difficult overall, but thats because the information needed to categorize the transacations were already available.
                <br><br>
                If I had picked a different topic I might've had to do more research and data collection to find more custom parameters to analyze with. machine learning is conceptualy not too complicated, but it requires a lot of data and math to do. Dont get me started on the syntax use.

We created a complete business model with user accounts, coin systems, avatar customization, leaderboards, even premium subscriptions.
                <br><br>
                Made Figma mockups, put together presentations, researched the ethics and social impact. It was fun thinking through all the business and design challenges, we ended doing a little presentation for the class shark tank style.

                The basis of the project was something similar to sweatcoin, a app that tracks the number of steps you take and turns it into a digital currency to spend. It's pretty interesting overall, honestly I could probably use a app like this with how much I scroll haha.

                Game jams are really fun to do when you have an idea of what you're doing and the people you're working with are talented. I participated in a couple during my time in college - Cat Fight Tactics, Frank's Big Day for Global Game Jam, Pub Puzzlers for the 49er Kickoff Game Jam, and the 2025 Spring Jam.
                <br><br>
                I mostly did asset creation, design and concept art. I did mostly behind-the-scenes support since I was usually drowning in coursework at the same time. (college was a hectic time)
                <br><br>
                Each jam taught me something new about working under pressure and collaborating with different people. Probably my favorite part about my time in college if I'm being honest. Getting to talk to and meet so many talented, likeminded individuals.
                <br><br>
                I really hope one day I can work with people like that again, I want to be passionate about what I'm working on and create things with people.
